# Image Processing using Graph Laplacian Operator

This project is the implementation of the Master Thesis [https://github.com/David-Wobrock/master-thesis-writing](https://github.com/David-Wobrock/master-thesis-writing).

The implementation was in two phases.
First, a Proof of Concept in Python, in the `python/` folder.
And a parallel approach for high-performance computing, in the `hpc/` folder, writting in C using [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/).
